A sample class which extends the functionality of ConsoleEngineBase demonstrating how to implement a simple utilty overriding just what you need.

### Credit
This code is tweaked from the original I found on [msdn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164014.aspx).  There were a couple of issues
with shell interaction on windows for cat'ing empty files at this code, also for echoing data at it (line ending caused some confusion).
